- 🚻 **Gender**

## ✈️ 1. Business vs. Leisure Travelers

::: {.card style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"}
**Insight**: Business travelers are **significantly more likely** to report satisfaction than leisure travelers.  
- Coefficient for `Biztravel`: **+1.163**, _p < 0.001_  
- Interaction `Customer * Biztravel`: strong positive effect

**Strategy**:
- 💼 Launch targeted digital campaigns like *"Fly Smart. Work Smarter."*  
- Highlight features that matter most to business travelers: WiFi, early boarding, legroom, and speed of check-in

**Execution**:

## 🎫 2. Loyalty-Based Targeting (Customer Status)

::: {.card style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"}
**Insight**: While the individual coefficient for `Customer` (loyalty status) isn’t significant, the **interaction with Biztravel** is — loyalty **combined with business travel** boosts satisfaction.

**Strategy**:
- 🎯 Promote loyalty tiers and benefits specifically to business flyers
- 📧 Design emails and SMS campaigns with milestone tracking ("You're 1 trip away from Gold status!")

**Execution**:
- Use past travel patterns to build lookalike audiences
- Retarget frequent flyers with app-based upgrade promotions

## 👤 3. Age-Based Personalization

::: {.card style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"}
**Insight**:  
- Age has a **negative main effect**: older passengers are slightly less satisfied (_Estimate = -0.014_)  
- However, this is moderated by service interactions (e.g., `Age * Seat`, `Age * Delay`, `Age * WiFi`)

**Marginal Effect of Age**:  
- Average marginal effect = **-0.00183**, suggesting subtle but meaningful impact per year

**Strategy**:
- 👵 For older segments: simplify online booking, enhance in-flight comfort
- 🧑 For younger flyers: emphasize digital features, in-app boarding, fast check-in

**Execution**:
- Age-customized landing pages and ads via programmatic targeting
- Build personas based on combined age × travel purpose segments

## 🚻 4. Gender-Responsive Messaging

::: {.card style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"}
**Insight**:  
- Gender (Female = 1) shows a significant **negative effect** on satisfaction (_Estimate = -0.529_)  
- But: interaction with `Leg_room` is **positive**, meaning improved legroom increases satisfaction among female travelers

**Strategy**:
- 🪑 Promote spacious seating and comfort-focused features in female-centric channels
- 💬 Consider running social campaigns focused on comfort, quiet zones, and premium seating

**Execution**:
- Pinterest/Instagram creative targeting comfort features
- Influencer campaigns showcasing “day-in-the-life” female business travel experiences
