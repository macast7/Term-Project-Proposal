    "text": "This section explores how demographic and behavioral insights from logistic regression modeling can inform United Airlines’ digital marketing strategy.\nWe focus on the following variables: - ✈️ Travel Purpose (Business vs. Leisure) - 🎫 Loyalty Status (Customer) - 👤 Age - 🚻 Gender\n\n\n\n\nInsight: Business travelers are significantly more likely to report satisfaction than leisure travelers.\n- Coefficient for Biztravel: +1.163, p &lt; 0.001\n- Interaction Customer * Biztravel: strong positive effect\nStrategy: - 💼 Launch targeted digital campaigns like “Fly Smart. Work Smarter.”\n- Highlight features that matter most to business travelers: WiFi, early boarding, legroom, and speed of check-in\nExecution: - Segment ad groups by travel purpose using CRM data - Run LinkedIn Ads and Google PPC campaigns on business-related travel terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight: While the individual coefficient for Customer (loyalty status) isn’t significant, the interaction with Biztravel is — loyalty combined with business travel boosts satisfaction.\nStrategy: - 🎯 Promote loyalty tiers and benefits specifically to business flyers - 📧 Design emails and SMS campaigns with milestone tracking (“You’re 1 trip away from Gold status!”)\nExecution: - Use past travel patterns to build lookalike audiences - Retarget frequent flyers with app-based upgrade promotions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight:\n- Age has a negative main effect: older passengers are slightly less satisfied (Estimate = -0.014)\n- However, this is moderated by service interactions (e.g., Age * Seat, Age * Delay, Age * WiFi)\nMarginal Effect of Age:\n- Average marginal effect = -0.00183, suggesting subtle but meaningful impact per year\nStrategy: - 👵 For older segments: simplify online booking, enhance in-flight comfort - 🧑 For younger flyers: emphasize digital features, in-app boarding, fast check-in\nExecution: - Age-customized landing pages and ads via programmatic targeting - Build personas based on combined age × travel purpose segments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight:\n- Gender (Female = 1) shows a significant negative effect on satisfaction (Estimate = -0.529)\n- But: interaction with Leg_room is positive, meaning improved legroom increases satisfaction among female travelers\nStrategy: - 🪑 Promote spacious seating and comfort-focused features in female-centric channels - 💬 Consider running social campaigns focused on comfort, quiet zones, and premium seating\nExecution: - Pinterest/Instagram creative targeting comfort features - Influencer campaigns showcasing “day-in-the-life” female business travel experiences\n\n\nThese strategies turn model-driven insights into highly actionable marketing approaches that respect demographic nuance while improving brand equity and passenger experience."
