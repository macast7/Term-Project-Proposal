This section presents the analytical work behind the project:  
**"What demographic factors and travel purpose predict customer satisfaction with United Airlines?"**

We use logistic regression and marginal effects analysis to evaluate how factors such as **travel purpose**, **loyalty status**, **age**, and **gender** contribute to customer satisfaction.

## 🧠 Analytical Objective

::: {.card style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"}
**Objective**:  
Examine how **demographic characteristics** and **type of travel** affect the likelihood of customer satisfaction.

**Key Variables**:
- `Biztravel` (Business vs. Leisure)
- `Customer` (Loyalty Status)
- `Age`
- `Female` (Gender)
:::

## 🔍 Methodology

::: {.card style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"}
**Model**: Logistic Regression  
- Binary outcome: `y = 1` if customer is satisfied, `0` otherwise  
- Included interaction terms to account for combined effects (e.g., `Age * Seat`, `Customer * Biztravel`)

**Diagnostics**:
- **Pseudo R²**: 0.566 — strong model fit  
- **% Correctly Predicted**: 88.5% — high predictive accuracy  
- **Marginal Effect (Age)**: -0.00183 — older age slightly reduces satisfaction

## 📊 Key Results & Interpretations

::: {.card style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"}
- **Travel Purpose**: Business travelers are significantly more likely to report satisfaction (**Estimate = +1.163**, p < 0.001)
- **Loyalty Status**: Alone not significant, but the interaction with business travel is very strong (**Estimate = +3.03**)
- **Age**: Negatively related to satisfaction but with nuanced interaction effects (e.g., service quality mitigates dissatisfaction)
- **Gender**: Female travelers report lower satisfaction on average (**Estimate = -0.528**), but positively influenced by better legroom

## 📈 Strategic Implications

::: {.card style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"}
- **Segmentation**: Personalize marketing and operational improvements by age, gender, and travel purpose.
- **Targeted Service Improvements**: Enhance seat comfort, WiFi, and in-flight services especially for demographics with lower satisfaction.
- **Model-Driven Campaigns**: Use regression findings to inform digital marketing (see [Digital Marketing Projects](digital-marketing.qmd))

The analytics not only identify key predictors of satisfaction but also serve as a foundation for performance-based marketing strategies and service design.
